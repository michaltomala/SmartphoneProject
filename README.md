# SmartphoneProject -
This is my project about smartphones for the Coders Lab bootcamp.I'm still working here.

This is for people who are intrested in technology,especially smartphones.

Page contains register and login user.
In additional I implement AuthFilter and AdminFilter, only admin can create new brand or smartphone,edit or delete.
He can also edit or delete user and it's validated everywhere. 


I used here Spring MVC and in the near future i would do services and rest api.
